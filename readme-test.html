<p>           1)     	This is <strong>YOUR</strong> free device - use it for whatever you need to</p>
<p>           2)     	You can access the internet for <strong>FREE</strong> until the initial data runs out</p>
<p>           3)     	There are no silly questions about how to use it or what to do so<strong> please ask</strong> for help from the person supporting you (most likely this will be the person who dropped off the device. They will have given you their number)</p>
<p>           4)     	Enjoy it. We are with you and will support you to use it for whatever you need</p>
<p>           5)     	Stay safe and keep in touch </p>

</ol><p><strong>Terms of Use</strong></p>
<p>In these terms, when we say Online Centre, we mean<strong> [name]</strong> at<strong> [Online Centre / organisation name].</strong></p>
<p>As Good Things Foundation is giving you a tablet or other device as part of the DevicesDotNow campaign, there are a few things that we need you to do and for you to be aware of which are explained below. </p>
<p>By accepting a device from Good Things Foundation, you are confirming that you have read and agree with the contents of this document. If you have any concerns or questions about what this document contains, please contact [your local Online Centre].</p>
<p><strong>The device itself</strong></p>
<p>We have done our best to source you a device, kindly donated by one of the participating business partners, which will allow you to get online and communicate with people during this time of lockdown caused by COVID-19. The device is new and will come with all necessary accessories (e.g. a charging cable).</p>
<p><strong>Ownership of the device</strong></p>
<p>By participating in the DevicesDotNow initiative and by accepting this device, you have become the legal owner of the device. But with that comes a responsibility to use it properly, repair it if it needs to be repaired, and if you would like to, insure it in case it gets lost, stolen or broken. </p>
<p><strong>Using the device</strong></p>
<p>You confirm that you are over the age of 18. If the device will be used by anyone under the age of 18, we ask that you keep an eye on how that person is using the device because you will be responsible for that young person's use.</p>
<p>We have given you this device on the assumption that you have access to the relevant equipment needed to safely connect this device to power supplies. If this assumption is incorrect, we ask that you obtain access to such power supplies. If you have any questions or concerns doing so, then please reach out to your local Online Centre.</p>
<p>If you are not sure how to use your device, particularly how to use it safely, we recommend reading the user manual. If a user manual is not available, please contact your local Online Centre who will be able to help you.</p>
<p>Should the device suffer from any functionality issue which makes the device unsafe to use, you should immediately stop using the device and get in touch with your local Online Centre for advice.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting your device to the internet</strong></p>
<p>We have done our best to provide each device with a pre-loaded amount of data to enable you to connect to the internet in the short to medium term. However, once that amount of pre-loaded data is gone, you will be  responsible for obtaining more data to enable you to continue accessing the internet. Please contact your local Online Centre if you need any help.</p>
<p><strong>Good Things Foundation's liability</strong></p>
<p>We have taken care when sourcing the device.  However, if you have a problem with the device please contact the Online Centre.</p>
<p>If something does go wrong, we do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence; for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; for breach of your legal rights in relation to the devices; and for defective devices under the Consumer Protection Act 1987. We will only be responsible if our negligence causes death or injury, or it would otherwise be unfair for us to not be held responsible.</p>
<p>We are not liable for any loss or damage that you might suffer when using the device to the extent: (a) we have complied with these terms and such losses arise solely as a result of you not following our guidance in these terms, or (b) that loss or damage could not reasonably have been foreseen. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the contract was made, both we and you knew it might happen,</p>
<p>We are not liable for business losses. We only supply the devices for domestic and private use.</p>
